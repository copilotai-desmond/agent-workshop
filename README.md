# Introductory Workshop on building agents
The aim of this repository is to support CoPilot AI's workshop on building agents with langgraph.

At the end of this workshop, we will have a running agent that uses the orchestrator pattern to orchestrate a travel itinerary to everyone's favorite destination.

Considerations for the itinerary will include:
- Budget
- Attractions
- Food Recommendations

## Launch
- vscode debugging enabled. Launch with F5
- npm run agent will also launch langgraph dev server
